This is a personal blog I made using **Jekyll** and **MDL** components

The objective of the design is to build a future-proof blog for the mobile-device age

## Features under Development

1. Installing disqus and integrating the material design features
2. Build a site navigation tool simiar to an android menu
3. Explore a few jekyll options that are available via github
4. Stress test with some real world blog
