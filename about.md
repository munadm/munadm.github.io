Hi there! Thank You for clicking on my face. This is a blog I made for fun using material design components.
Its also a pretty cool platform for collecting and projecting my thoughts


## Who am I

I am a senior with a major in Computer Science and Business at Lehigh University.
I have had extensive experience with internships at large financial institutions as well as a programming academy located at Princeton. I love taking run of the mill projects and giving them a new paint of coat
I am currently looking for full-time employment and hope to use my blog as a log as a narration of my fortunes.
In my spare time I throw concerts, race beds and dance in a step team!
