title: Penn Apps XIII - Intro to Pivoting
---

I spent this weekend at [PennApps] (http://2015f.pennapps.com/) . Its the largest hackathon of its kind and was hosted on the wells fargo center. I was mostly motivated because I wanted to go with my friends Chase Brewster Michael Green and Thomas Potenza


It was probably the most fun I had at a hackathon. We got a tons of swag including hoodie pillows from Microsoft. I also got to meet a few great companies and notably try out some great tech.


We started off with a very ambitious hack using IBM's new PaaS service Bluemix. However though the Watson API was really cool and the amount of services they were going to provide was downright magical, we couldn't use it due to the lack of datasets we would need

So mid Saturday we decided to go with something completely different. My friend and I were browsing through some twitter feeds and we saw that most of politicians had such a formulaic approach that a robot can probably do it.
So thats what we did. We were able to grab all the past 200 or so tweets from the twitter page of every major democratic and republican candidate and then based on an algorithm create a bot that tweets as an average republican or democrat.
The result of which is now known as [House of Bots](http://houseofbots.co/).


All in all it was a very cool experience, we got to try out new tech, got free swag and ate a ridiculous amount of junk food. Cant wait for PennApps 2016 - My last PennApps.
